# Drag and drop project

This project is fully done in TypeScript and features a fully functional "drag and drop to-do list" where users can add their daily tasks to the list and mark them as finished by dragging them into the "finished" section

## How to run

First run `npm init` to install all the necessary package dependencies, then use `npm run production-build` to create the bundled JavaScript file and run `npm start` to create a dev server which will then run and dev server on localhost:3000

## Known bugs

Please keep in mind that for any development purposes, the live server will **not** refresh automatically, this issue is most likely Node related), in order to fix this issue please run `npm run build` and refresh your localhost page whenever you want to see any changes you made in your code
